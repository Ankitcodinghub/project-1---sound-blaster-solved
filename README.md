<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The purpose of this project is to implement a Stack ADT in the two most common ways, an array and a linked list.

Your Stack implementation will be used to do sound manipulation, namely reversing a sound clip. This process, called ‚Äúbackmasking,‚Äù was used by musicians including the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and Ozzy Ozbourne, although it seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years.

Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking">here</a> for a history of this (sometime constroversial!) practice. ‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù you say, ‚ÄúCSE 143 never taught me how to work with music‚Ä¶‚Äù Don‚Äôt worry! Most of the hard work has already been done.

<div align="center">
<hr align="center" size="2" width="75%">
</div>
<h2><a name="Assignment"></a>The Assignment</h2>
You will write a program that reads a sound file in the .dat format (explained below), and writes another .dat sound file which is the reverse of the first. We provide you with a class <tt>Reverse</tt> whose main method reads in a .dat sound file, puts the sounds values on a stack, pops them off in reverse order, and puts these reversed values in a new .dat sound file. We‚Äôve also provided you with a <tt>DStack</tt> interface, which defines a stack that holds double values. Your first job is to look over these files and become familiar with them.

You need to provide <i>two</i> stack implementations, one using an array and the other using a linked list. They should be called <tt>ArrayStack</tt> and <tt>ListStack</tt>, respectively. They should implement the interface <tt>DStack</tt>, which we provide to you. Once you provide these implementations, <tt>Reverse</tt> should work and create backwards sound files. It shouldn‚Äôt take more than a page or two of code to provide the implementation. Your array implementation should hold around a million elements. You may assume that the array won‚Äôt fill completely (although we‚Äôll discuss what happens in that case in the writeup questions). Both ArrayStack and ListStack should throw an EmptyStackException if pop() or peek() is called when the stack is empty. To use EmptyStackException, add the following line to your file:

<code>import java.util.EmptyStackException;</code>

The <tt>Reverse</tt> program takes 3 arguments. The first is the word <tt>array</tt> or <tt>list</tt>, and specifies which implementation to use. The next two are the input and output .dat file names (you need to include the .dat extension). Running the program will depend on your system; from a command line it will look something like the following.

<pre>java Reverse list in.dat out.dat</pre>
In an IDE there is usually a dialog for setting program parameters which contains a field for the program arguments.

Read the section on <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/#DigitalSound">Digital Sound</a> to learn how to create a .dat file. To get you started, we‚Äôve created a .dat file <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/bot.dat">here</a>.

<i>For details on what to turn in for this assignment and how, read the section on <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/#Logistics">Logistics</a>. For a quick reminder of how interfaces work in Java, see <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/#Java">Java Reminder</a>.</i>

In addition, answer the following questions and provide the answer in your writeup.

<h3><a name="Questions"></a>Writeup Questions</h3>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Who/What did you find helpful for this project?</li>
<li>How did you test that the final program is correct?</li>
<li>The file <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/secret.wav"><tt>secret.wav</tt></a> is a backwards recording of a word or short phrase. Use <tt>sox</tt> (or another converter) and your program to reverse it, and write that as the answer to this question.</li>
<li>Did you use any classes from the Java framework or other class library? (Remember, as stated in the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/programming-guidelines.shtml">programming guidelines</a>, if the answer to this question is anything other than ‚Äúno‚Äù, you may get a low score on this project if you use the library to implement your stacks!)

(Addendum: it‚Äôs OK to use <tt>java.util.EmptyStackException</tt>!)</li>
<li>What happens if you exceed the maximum size of the array implementation of <tt>DStack</tt>? Can you think of other ways to handle this case, if you were allowed to change <tt>DStack.java</tt> and <tt>Reverse.java</tt>? Be specific: refer to particular lines of code that would change, list any exceptions you would add and who would throw them, describe who catches any such exceptions and how they are handled, etc. Referring to comments you have inserted in your code is the best way to do this. Give one good point of your current implementation and one good point of the alternative implementation you describe.</li>
<li>Let‚Äôs pretend that, instead of a <tt>DStack</tt> interface, you were given a fully-functional FIFO <tt>Queue</tt> class. How might you implement this project (ie, simulate a <tt>Stack</tt>) with one or more instances of a FIFO <tt>Queue</tt>?

Write pseudocode for your <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> operations. Refer to the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/writtenhw-guidelines.shtml">Written Homework Guidelines</a> for instructions on writing pseudocode.

(<b>Addendum:</b> Assume your Queue class provides the operations enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty and size).</li>
<li>In the previous question, what trade-offs did you notice between a <tt>Queue</tt> implementation of a <tt>Stack</tt> and your original array-based implementation? Which implementation would you choose, and why?</li>
<li>Include a description of how your project goes ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù the basic requirements (if it does).</li>
<li>What did you enjoy about this assignment? What did you hate? What could you have done better?</li>
<li>Any other information you would like to include.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="AboveAndBeyond"></a>Going Above and Beyond</h3>
The following list of suggestions are meant for you to try if you finish the requirements early. Recall that any extra-credit points you earn for these are kept separate from your assignment score and will be used to adjust your grade at the end of the quarter, as detailed in the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/grading-policies.shtml">course grading policy</a>.

<ul type="disc">
<li>(1 point) Change the array implementation to grow when it becomes full.</li>
<li>(2 points) Try implementing the Karplus-Strong algorithm (to generate ‚Äúreverb‚Äù sounds). A description of this algorithm is available <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/karplus_strong.shtml">here</a>.</li>
<li>(5 points) Assuming that your .dat input file contained a single note, try writing a program which will output a single-octave scale beginning at that note. Would the notes of an ‚Äúevenly spaced‚Äù scale grow logarithmically, linearly, polynomially, or according to some other function? For more information about the evenly-spaced scale, refer to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_scale">this article</a>. To earn full credit, you must start from an actual recorded note (not a synthetic one) and generate the single-octave scale.</li>

<h2><a name="DigitalSound"></a>How Digital Sound Works</h2>
We will view sound as a continuous function of time from the positive real numbers (time) to the interval [-1.0, 1.0] (amplitude). Since a computer can‚Äôt ‚Äúhold‚Äù a function defined on the reals, we have to approximate the function. We do this by measuring (or ‚Äú<i>sampling</i> ‚Äú) the sound several thousand times per second.

<p align="center"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/ADC.gif?resize=241%2C185" width="241" height="185" border="0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="lazyload" style="--smush-placeholder-width: 241px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 241/185;">

This process is called ‚ÄúAnalog to Digital Conversion‚Äù, or ADC. The number of times per second the sound is sampled is called the <i>sample rate </i>and is measured in<i> Hertz</i>. For example, CDs are recorded at 44100 samples per second, or 44.1kHz. Wait a minute! Is this the right class? I thought this was CSE326.

<h3><a name="Sox"></a>Sox</h3>
The only sound file format you need to know about is the .dat format described below. You don‚Äôt even have to know very much about that either, as we‚Äôre giving you the code that reads and writes that format. In order to play sounds you produce, you need a way to convert the .dat file into a format that common media players (Windows Media Player, winamp, RealPlayer, etc.) understand. We‚Äôll describe one way to do it below; however, you‚Äôre free to use any converter you can find.

<tt>sox</tt> is a UNIX command-line utility whose name stands for ‚ÄúSOund eXchange‚Äù. It allows you to convert between many different sound formats including .wav, .au, etc. In particular, <tt>sox</tt> allows you to convert to and from .dat sound files. .dat files are useful because they are human-readable, text-based, sound files. Note that you will need to perform this conversion to answer one of the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/#Questions">writeup questions</a>.

There is a windows version of <code>sox</code> available, and the source archive is known to compile and work on OS X 10.4. The program is also installed on the lab machines. You can download versions from the project page at <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sox/sox12181.zip?download">SourceForge</a>. The windows version is also a command-line program and works in the same way as the UNIX version described below. Follow <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/09sp/projects/proj1/Sox_Usage.txt">this link</a> for some hints on using it.

The general strategy for using <code>sox</code> is as follows.

<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Take a .wav sound file of your choosing (e.g. <tt>secret.wav</tt>). This sound shouldn‚Äôt be longer than a couple seconds, or your program will run out of memory.</li>
<li>Convert it to a .dat file: <tt>sox secret.wav secret.dat</tt></li>
<li>Manipulate it with the program you will write: <tt>java Reverse secret.dat secret-revealed.dat</tt></li>
<li>Convert it back to a .wav file: <tt>sox secret-revealed.dat secret-revealed.wav</tt></li>
<li>Listen to it! (Use your favorite sound player.)</li>
</ol>
That‚Äôs all there is to it!

<h3><a name="DatFileFormat"></a>The .dat File Format</h3>
The .dat file format starts with one line describing the sample rate of the sound file. <i>This line is required.</i> The rest of the file is composed of two columns of numbers. The first column consists of the time (measured in seconds) when the sample was recorded, and the second column contains the value of the sample, between -1.0 and 1.0. This is the beginning of a sample .dat file. Notice that the numbers in the first column increase by 1/44100 each step. This is because the sample rate is 44.1kHz.

Note that for this assignment, you shouldn‚Äôt have to deal much with the .dat file yourself, as the provided <tt>Reverse.java</tt> does all the lifting for you. All you have to do is implement the stacks. We are explaining the format because it will be helpful for you if you want to write a short file by hand to run, to verify if your program works.

<h2><a name="Java"></a>Java Reminder</h2>
For this assignment you will need to instantiate an interface, <tt>DStack</tt>, in two different ways. The <tt>DStack</tt> interface defines a simple stack:

<pre><code>
interface DStack {

  boolean isEmpty();

  void push(double d);

  double pop();

  double peek();

}
  </code></pre>
An actual interface includes comments, including a description of how <code>pop()</code> and <code>peek()</code> should behave if they are called when the stack is empty.

To implement this interface, write a class as follows:

<pre><code>
class ArrayStack implements DStack {

  public ArrayStack() {
    // Your constructor
  }

  public boolean isEmpty() {
    // Your isEmpty()
  }

  public void push(double d) {
    // Your push()
  }

  // continue with the rest of the functions,
  // along with any member variables, etc.

}
  </code></pre>
The <tt>ListStack</tt> class should be defined similarly. You should include appropriate comments as needed. In particular, each file should begin with a JavaDoc comment that describes the class in the file, and includes your name and other identifying information.
